# Parallel port scripting language - “MicroScript” (2011)

Developed a scripting language to reduce hassle of C/C++ based programming and interfacing with some external devices. This scripting language had its own loop and conditional blocks. The runtime environment section is incomplete and now the project is deprecated.
